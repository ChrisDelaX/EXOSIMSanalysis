Put these files in this directory:

  4m_CpCb_20160824-cd-mods-determ.json
  RVplanets_ipac_2016-06-15.votable

Run:

  $ python make_keepout.py

It dumps results as .csv to /tmp

Run:

  $ matlab
  >> exosims_keepout_graphics

It needs to access the CSV's -- edit it to uncomment the ROOT_DIR line so it looks in /tmp.
It needs the export_fig command (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig)

It will put movies and graphics into /tmp.
